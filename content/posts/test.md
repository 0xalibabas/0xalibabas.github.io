Welcome. This blog serves as a public notebook for my work in offensive security and vulnerability research.

The goal here is not to write perfect guides. It is to document:

* Techniques I use or study
* Research that often turns into bug bounty reports
* Write-ups when possible
* And thoughts on offensive security in general

This is a space for practical, hands-on security content. I hope you find it useful :)
