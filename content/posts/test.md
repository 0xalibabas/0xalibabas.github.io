# Welcome to 0x\_alibabas

I finally decided to start this blog to share my journey in **red team operations**, **vulnerability research**, and the things I learn (or break) along the way.

The goal here is not to write perfect guides. It is to document:

* techniques I use or study
* research that often turns into bug bounty reports
* write-ups when possible
* and thoughts on offensive security in general

You can expect real-world cases when I am able to share them, PoCs, interesting bugs, and also mistakes that ended up teaching me valuable lessons.

If you enjoy exploring how vulnerabilities appear, how to exploit Windows internals, or just want to follow the hands-on side of security, this blog is for you.
